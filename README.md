# LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation

This repository contains code and examples for implementing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in neural networks, particularly focusing on attention mechanisms. LoRA efficiently adapts large pre-trained models to specific tasks by injecting trainable low-rank matrices into the model's layers, reducing computational resources and time required for fine-tuning.

## Understanding LoRA

LoRA is based on the principle of low-rank decomposition. In the context of attention models, it decomposes weight matrices into two smaller matrices, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational cost.

### Basic Concept

Given a weight matrix $W$, LoRA approximates it as:
$ W \approx A \times B $
where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank matrices with $r \ll d$, and $d$ is the dimension of the original matrix.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of parameters to be fine-tuned.
- **Scalability**: Makes it feasible to adapt large models to new tasks with limited resources.
- **Performance**: Maintains high performance while significantly reducing computational requirements.
